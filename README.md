# odin-recipes

This site is the first web project I've completed and, while suitably ametuerish it is finished. That is something that I can't say with the other projects that never got out of the planning phase.

The point of this web site is more than providing some barely useful recipes to readers but to showcase that I can in fact make websites at the most basic level. 

Most of the learning with this project happened behind the scenes. Not only is this my first 'real' web project it the first one that utilized version control, the linux terminal and was published to GitHub. The efficiency increase that came with learning the command line not only for git but also for directory navigation and file manipulation did wonders for my productivity.
