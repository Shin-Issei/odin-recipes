    <p>
      Who says that just becuase you're flat broke you can't enjoy some top
      quality food? I know my wallet says that <i>all the time</i>. Instead of
      top quality food let's have some top ramen with a little more dignity.
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Thin Slices of Beef (any cut)</li>
      <li>Nongshim Instant Ramen</li>
      <li>2 1/3 cups of filtered water</li>
      <li>Seasoned Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the beef slices with salt and pepper and then sear them to
        preferred doneness.
      </li>
      <li>While the beef is cooking boil the water and add the noodles</li>
      <li>
        Ensure that the noodles don't cook for more than 2minutes or else they
        will be too gooey
      </li>
      <li>
        Kill the heat on the noodles at the 1:15 mark and add the flavor packet
        that came with the noodles.
      </li>
      <li>Put the steak slices in a bowl and then add the ramen on top.</li>
      <li>Stir and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
